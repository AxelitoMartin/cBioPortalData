\title{Obtain pre-packaged data from cBioPortal and represent as
a MultiAssayExperiment object}
\usage{
cBioDataPack(
  cancer_study_id,
  use_cache = TRUE,
  split.field = c("Tumor_Sample_Barcode", "ID"),
  names.field = c("Hugo_Symbol", "Entrez_Gene_Id", "Gene")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cancer_study_id}{The cBioPortal study identifier as in
\url{https://cbioportal.org/webAPI}}

\item{use_cache}{logical (default TRUE) create the default cache location
and use it to track downloaded data. If data found in the cache, data will
not be re-downloaded. A path can also be provided to data cache location.}

\item{split.field}{A character vector of possible column names for the column
that is used to identify samples in a mutations or copy number file.}

\item{names.field}{A character vector of possible column names for the column
that is used to label ranges from a mutations or copy number file.}
}
\value{
A \linkS4class{MultiAssayExperiment} object
}
\description{
The \code{cBioDataPack} function allows the user to
download and process cancer study datasets found in MSKCC's cBioPortal.
Output datasets use the \linkS4class{MultiAssayExperiment} data
representation to faciliate analysis and data management operations.
}
\details{
The list of datasets can be found in the \code{studiesTable} dataset
by doing \code{data("studiesTable")}. Some datasets may not be available
for download and are not guaranteed to be represented as MultiAssayExperiment
data objects. After taking a random sample of 100
(using \code{set.seed(1234)}), we were able to succesfully represent about
76 percent of the study identifiers as MultiAssayExperiment objects. Please
refer to the #' \href{http://cbioportal.org/data_sets.jsp}{website} for the
full list of available datasets. Users who would like to prioritize
particular datasets should open GitHub issues at the URL in the \code{DESCRIPTION}
file. For a more fine-grained approach to downloading data from the
cBioPortal API, refer to the \code{cBioPortalData} function.
