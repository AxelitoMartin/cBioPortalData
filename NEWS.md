## CHANGES IN VERSION 2.0.0

### New features

* Updated the `README.md` file from R Markdown file.
* Make use of `rapiclient` on CRAN
* Prepare package for Bioconductor submission

## CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.1

### New features

* Package supports nearly all study identifiers based on recent tests
* Only a handful of study identifiers are unsuccessful (create an issue to
prioritize).

### Bug fixes and minor improvements

* Make better use of the API return values to craft the sample map for
`MultiAssayExperiment` creation
* Additional data included in the metadata slot of the `MultiAssayExperiment`
object. Future revisions will include this data as `rowData`.
* Change vignette titles for build

## CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1.0

### New features

* `cBioDataPack` allows users to download packaged data objects from
download.cbioportal.org/
* Data packs are cached using `BiocFileCache` to avoid re-downloading
* `cBioPortalData` lets users query the cbioportal.org API and retrieve slices
of data according to gene, molecular profile identifiers, etc.
* Queries through `cBioPortalData` use a caching mechanism to avoid repeat
downloads of data and improve load times
* Both functions return a `MultiAssayExperiment` as the primary data
representation
* Only a number of study datasets are currently possible to load. Issues
can arise with mismatched or munged identifiers
* The cBioPortal API representation is handled by the `AnVIL` package
which makes use of `rapiclient` to provide an automatic R interface to the API

### Bug fixes and minor improvements

* Data pack downloads use an alternative method for download when a download
fails
